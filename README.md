# Medical Imaging

This folder contains Python programs related to Medical imaging, specifically focusing on calculations related to k-space, field-of-view (FOV), and regions of interest (ROI) in MRI.

## Program 1: Calculating FOV and k-space Parameters

- **File:** `fov_k_space_calculation.py`
- **Description:** This program calculates FOV, Δk, k-space field-of-view (kFOV), and pixel width (Δw) based on provided FOV values.

### Usage
1. Run the program `fov_k_space_calculation.py`.
2. Input the FOV in centimeters when prompted.
3. The program will display calculated values for Δk, kFOV, and Δw based on the FOV input.

## Program 2: ROI Size Calculation in k-space

- **File:** `roi_k_space_size.py`
- **Description:** This program calculates the size of a Region of Interest (ROI) in k-space based on given ROI dimensions and FOV values.

### Usage
1. Run the program `roi_k_space_size.py`.
2. Input the width and height of the ROI in millimeters.
3. Input the FOV in millimeters when prompted.
4. The program will display the size of the ROI in k-space for both x and y directions.
